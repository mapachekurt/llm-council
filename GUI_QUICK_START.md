## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why do I need Python?**
A: Python is the programming language the Council is built with. It's free and safe.

**Q: Is my API key safe?**
A: Yes! It's saved in a file on your computer called `.env` that never goes to GitHub.

**Q: What if I see an error?**
A: Look at the error message in the GUI window. It will tell you what's wrong.

**Q: Can I use this on my phone?**
A: Not directly. But you can deploy it to the cloud (Tab 3) and access it from your phone!

**Q: What's "deploying"?**
A: It means uploading your Council to Google's servers so it runs 24/7 on the internet.

**Q: Do I need to know what I'm doing?**
A: No! Just follow the tabs in order and click buttons.
